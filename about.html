    <p><strong>Real Conversations Rooted in the Green Industry</strong></p>

    <p>Welcome to The Green Talk Podcast, a space where stories grow, leadership takes root, and the future of the green industry gets real.</p>

    <p>I’m Mizraim Mata, your host. For nearly two decades, I’ve been part of the green industry, working my way from the ground up to becoming a Regional Manager for Turf and Plant Health Care, overseeing nine branches in South Carolina. Along the way, I’ve seen the evolving challenges our industry faces, labor shortages, changing regulations, client expectations, and the pressure to adopt new technology, but I’ve also seen the innovation, grit, and leadership that make this industry so special.</p>

    <p>I created The Green Talk Podcast to shine a light on the people behind the progress.</p>

    <p>This show is for landscape professionals, superintendents, tech innovators, business leaders, and anyone passionate about creating greener, more sustainable spaces. We talk operations, culture, leadership, plant health, technology, and what it really takes to succeed, not just survive in this field.</p>

    <p>Each episode features candid conversations with people who are out there doing the work, building companies, managing crews, transforming landscapes, and challenging the status quo. From drone tech to turf science, from sustainable design to boots-on-the-ground leadership, The Green Talk dives deep, with authenticity and purpose.</p>

    <p>This podcast isn’t just about landscapes. It’s about the people shaping them and the future they’re building.</p>

    <p><em>Thanks for listening, and welcome to the conversation.</em></p>

    <p>— <strong>Mizraim Mata</strong><br>Host, The Green Talk Podcast</p>
